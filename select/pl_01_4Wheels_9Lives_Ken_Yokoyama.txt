Angels have no smiles anymore
Watch as dark clouds cover skies
everywhere
Why do they keep
blocking my way?
I'll just go back down below
Need me no more,
Silence my words
Fine, it's their freedom to
think what they want
No matter how many times we
die, we will rise from the dead
Yeah Oh, oh
Yeah oh
4wheels and 9lives,
that's what we have
Go ahead eat a feast of money
While you're at it eat a bag of
dicks
The target they're aiming at is
Only just my last dead body
Yeah Oh, oh
Yeah oh
4wheels and 9lives,
that's what we have
Yeah Oh, oh
yeah oh
4wheels and 9lives,
that’s what we have
